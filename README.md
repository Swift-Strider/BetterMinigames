# BetterMinigames

_A plugin for Pocketmine which adds support for various minigames._

## ü•á Features

You can make several customizable minigames for your pocketmine server that is accessible through commands, forms, and both. You may choose to make a new temporary world, so that players playing different instances of an arena are separate from each other, or build lobbies with arenas that allow spectators to watch from behind and join via command.

## üìñ Terminology for BetterMinigames

-   **ArenaType:** A base minigame type that arenas build upon. Not to be confused with arenas, which are built by admins. These are predefined types made in code. _(ex. SkyWars, Bedwars, or Duels)_
-   **Arena:** Holds a reference to a level as well as extra metadata for the ArenaType it's assigned to. _(ex. An arena for bedwars would keep track of it's map, and it may have metadata defined that doubles the resources dropped)_
-   **ArenaMeta:** Data that's specific to an ArenaType. Customizable options will vary between different ArenaTypes.
-   **Game (WIP):** Used in the `/play` command (WIP as well). This holds multiple arenas, and will showcase them to players as "maps." (Example use case: One game to hold solo skywars maps another for doubles)
-   **MinigameInstance:** A running instance of an arena. These could be spawned via `/play` (WIP), or through `/duel` (WIP again).

Be creative...
...What I mean is, for example, if you'd like to make a spleef minigame for your server, but `Spleef` isn't an avaiblable minigame type start by choosing something that closely resemble spleef, like `Duels`. After that you can force a kit that gives players shovels and snowballs, and have players die when they when they sink too low.
